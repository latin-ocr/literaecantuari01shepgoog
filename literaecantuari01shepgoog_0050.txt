to an oll'shoot of the long-standing disputo above
described between the Archhishops oi Cant terbury and
York as to the primacy. The northern Archhishop
from time to time in passing through towns of the
sont thern province chose to make his cavalcade assume
something of the form of a state processior, at tho
end of which he rode “cruce praevia''-with his up·
lifted cross borne before him. The Archbishops of
Oanterbury naturally endeavouredtoprcvent this assump-
tion, especially as their rivale acquired a custo’m of .
giving episcopal benediction ιο the crowds who met them
in the roads, and evento the congregatione of the
churches which they attended during their progress.
Archbishop Becket was the first who resisted this en·
croachmentoftherivalprelate. The persona] animosityex·
istingbetween Becket and Rogeronork caused the latter
to take every possible opportunity of defying the former3
whilst the unyielding character ofBecket led him to resist
an infringement oi his privilege by an opponent3 which he
would, however, have done, evenis the offendor had been
his nearest friend. In ordert tocounteract Becket’s op mn ‚Q
posi tion, his adversery epphed to the Pope for an euthontyse Aroi-

mission was revoked, but the controversy was not set
at rest when the tragedy of 1170 removed one of tho
disputante. Another early instance of this cncroachment
occurred in 1193, immediately after the clection oi Arch-

Bady next ensuing‚ under 0 severe penalty. Know 11101,
011 St. Mery Magdalen’e dey, we were on the spot, end
surveyed the well there which 1100 been began, 01
0111 own proper eost through defeult of the Bailiff end
of the collectore of the said mereh3 end the seme
day we hed the very best men 011110 town 01801111-
wieh to dine with neat Eustry, end many of them
advised 110 thet we ought 10 consult you about these
matters, 1010001001 the proprietors 010 interpoeing deleye
00 thet the whole 0001 will fell upon us. And on 111111

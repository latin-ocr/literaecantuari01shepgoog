The object cf this work is to publish notices ol all lrnovvn sources ol British
history, both printed and uuprinted, in one continued sequence. The materials,
when historical (as distinguished from biographieal), are arranged under the
year in which the latest event ie recorded in the chronicle or history, end not
under the period in which its author, real or supposed, flourisbed. Biographies
are enumerated under the year in which the person commemorated died, and not
under the year in which the life vas written. This arrangement has tvo
advantages ; the materiale lor any given period may be seen at a glauce; and
if the reader knovvs the time vrheu an author wrote, and the number ol years
that had clapsed bet veen the dete olthe events and the time the writer flourished,
he vill generally be enabled to form a fair estimate ol the comparative velue of
the narrative itsell. A brief analysis ci each vrorlr has been added vrhen deserviri
it, in which original portione are distinguished from mere compilatione. Ii
possible, the sources are indicated from which compilatione have bean
derived. A biogmphical slretch ol the author of each piece hasbeen edded,aud
a brief notice ol such British authors ae bave vritten on historical subiecta.

Greeting. Whereas we have heard that our Warden
at Orpington by our order was prepared to have delivered
to your servant, the timber which we had assigned to
you in our wood at Oekholt, whieh is very near to y0u3
and your servant answered to our Wardep, that he would ,
rather buy timber for you in the ordinary market, than
despoil us of so much timber ; therefore lay the fault upon

’ your said servant, and upon no other man And plesse
to know, that the little timber which is remaining in our
woods of Longbeaeh and Reggesterne does not suffice
ior the maintenahee of our houses, and milis which we
have in that district. Adieu‚ he. Given at Canterbury‚
the 5th day ,of March, in the year oi graee 1330.

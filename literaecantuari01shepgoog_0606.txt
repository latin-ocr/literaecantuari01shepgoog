Richard by God's permission Prior doc. to his very
dear and well-beloved in God John Joseph Mayor of
Dover, greeting doc Whereas our Holy Father in God
John, the Pope who now is, has especially commanded
us by his bulls, as principal executor of the cause of Sir
John de Nottingham Person of tho Ohurch of Buckland,
to make restitution to him of the said church, together
withan its profits accruing since the time that the said
Sir John has been forcibly kept out oi his right, as
clearly appears by his bulls and by his process in the
said Oourt ot Rome; we have understood that our
deputies and sub-executore of the (causa of the) said
Person do not dare to approach Dovcr‚ nor to go to his
said church for the purpose of executing the bulls of the
said Pope, from fear of the‘ threats which certain men of
Dover have uttered at the instigationes his adversaries,
to tho no small peril of those who disobey and oppose
the commandments of tho said Pop03 we (therefore)
pray you as earnestly aa we ean that you will plesse to
assist, and to perurit that law and right may be done to
the said sir John and that you will opposo the malice
of those who foolishly interpose to disturb the reposo of
Holy Church in this case; so that the said parson may
securely come with his sub-executore and exhibit hisbulls
and read and explain them in English‚as is usual, together
with other instrumenta which hc has in his support from
the aforesaid Poprr, and that ho may receive restitution
of his said church and perform the will of the said Pope
in proper form, whom we are all bound to obey and
devoutly to yield to. Please to report to us by some
passenger what is daneon behalf of this matter when
the time shall arrivs. Farewell doc. ·

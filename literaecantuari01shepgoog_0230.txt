’ Το his very dear ‘and well-beloved in (iod, greeting.
Sir, seeing that by a paltry outery or trumpeting of
people passing inland, the inhabitants may be easily
much alarmed without cause, and less ready at another
time to go down to the sea when there is real need, it
appears proper that you should send to the Sheriff that
he may cause to be proclaimed‚ and forbid through-
out the whole oounty in churches, faire, markets, and
elsewhere, in all places where people may be assembled‚
both within privileged arem and without them, that no
one shall be so bold, on pain of imprisonment, as to raise
the common my, or ιο sound trumpet or blow horn,
before the people who are dwelling nearest ιο the sea
raise the cmwmoo cry, and blow horna when they seethe
enemy on the sea andapproaching land And, know, Sir,
that now thirty years ago in the time of King Edward,
tbis was how the thing was done3 and also sixty years
back from the present time,' m , the days of King
Hemy his father when again there was a guard on the
seueoast). As ιο these things you will do that which
seems ιο you best ιο be done. sod be with you, who
keep you and all belonging ιο you Given at (lanter-
bury' the ιιι day oi October, in the year ol grace
1324.

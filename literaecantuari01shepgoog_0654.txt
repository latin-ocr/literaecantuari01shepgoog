This work has long been justly celebrated, bnt not thoronghly understood until
Mr. Stuhbs' edition. The earlier portion, extending from 732 to 1148, appears
to be a copy of a compilation made in Northnmbria about 1161, ιο which
Hovedcn added little. From 1148 ιο nst—a very valuable portion of this
work-the matter is derived from another source, to which Hoveden appears to
have supplied little, and not always judiciously. From 111011119111 the
portion which corresponds wlth the 0111111111 known under the name of
Benedict of Peterborough (sce No. 49); bnt it is not a copy, being sometimes
an abridgment, at others a paraphrase; occasionally the two works entirely
agree5 showing that both writers bad acccss to the same materiale, bnt dealt
with them differently. From 1191 ιο 1101 may be saidto be wholly Howeden's
work3 it is extremely valuable‚ and an authority of the first importence.

’111 original of this chronicle bas passed under various names. ’111 title os
⁴‘ Annals of Loch 06 ” was given to it by Professor O'Curry, on the ground that
it was transcribed for Brian blac Dermot, an Irish chieftain‚ who resided on the
island in [och 06, 11 the county of Roscommon. It adds much to the materiale

- for the civil and ecclesiastical history of Ireland ; and contains many curicus
references to English and foreign afflairs, not noticed in any other chronicle.

This book contains the ancient ordinances and lawe relating to the nary,
and was probably compiled for the use of the Lord High Admiral of haguno.
Seldcn calls it the ‘⁴ jewcl of the Admiralty Records.’' Prynne ascribes to the
Black Book the same authority in the Admirulty as the Black and Bed Rocks
have in the Oourt of Exchequcr, and most English writers on maritime law
recognize its importante.

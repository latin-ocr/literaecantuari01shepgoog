Orthe aeth of J anuary 1857, the Master of the llolls
submitted to the Trcasury a proposal for the publication .
oi materials for the History of this country from the
Invasion of the Romans to the reign of 'Hem-y VIII.

The Master ol the Rolls suggested that these materials
should be selected ior publication under competent
editors without reference to periodica] or chronological
arrangement, without mutilation or abridgment, prefer·
ence being given, in the first instance, to such materials
as were most scarce and valuable.

He proposed that each chronicle or historical docu-
ment to be edited should be treated in the same way as
if the editor were engaged on an Editio Princeps; and
'ior this purpose the most correct text should be formed
from an accurate collation of the best MSS.

To render the work more generally useful, tbc Master

, of the Rolls suggested that the editor should give an
l account of the MSS. employed by him, oi their ago and
¹ their peculiarities ; that he should add to the work a

brief account of the life and times of the author, and
any remarks necessary to explain the chronology; but
no other note or comment was to be allowed, except

- what might be necessary to establish the correctness of
³ the text.

Dear sons in dod, some people have given us 10 under-
stand that among yourselves (under the pretence os a
request which our Lord the King has made 10 you sor
assistance in men-atarms against the Secta, who have
begun to fight against him in contravention of the truce
still in soree and established between us and them) you
have determined to charge the lands, tenements, and
rents appropriated to the Prior and Convent of our
Ohurch of the Trinity at Canterbury ζ which possessione
it holds in pure and perpetual alins) to make con-
tribution with you towards the fumishing of the said
men-atarms3 which thing was never before seen 01
heard, respecting which we wonder greatly3 nor can
we certainly believe that you would thus dishonour
and burden your Mother (lhurch, you who are
peculiarly bound to sustain and maintain her franchiscs,
on account of the great honour which owing to this
Ghurch you receive from day to day. 'Pherefore wc
earnestly require, as much as wc can or know, that

other good and holy bodies which therain lie, wrll 1101
allow nor agree that sochen unbecoming demand
shall be made, 10 the prejudice cf the said Oburoh of
Canterbury, which is the most solemn and the freest 111

On 25 J nly 1822, the Hense of (lammens presented nn address to the Orown,
aain g that the editions of the works of onr ancient historiens were inconvenieut
nd defective ; that many of their writings still remained in manuscript, and, in
nme caseaiu a single copy only. They added, “that an uniform and con·

venient edition of the whole, published under His Majesty’s royal sanction,
¹ would be an undertaking hononrable to His Majesty’s reign, and conducite to
‘ the adwancement of historica] and constitutional knowledge ; that the House
‘ therefore humbly besonght His Majesty, that He would be gracionsly pleesed
'‘ to give such directiousas His Majesty‚ in His wisdom, mtght think lit, for
“ the publication of a complete edition of the ancient historiens of this realm,
‘⁸ and assured Hie Mejesty that whatever expense might be necessary for this

νῩἪῐιιῬοεθ would be made good.’' . ι
e Master of the Rolls, being very destrons that effect should be grven to the

resolution of the Hense of Oommone, submitted to Her Ma'esty’s lheasury in
185⁷ a plan for the publication of the ancient chronioles enti memoriale of the
United Kingdom‚ and it was adopted accordingly. In selecting these werke, it
was considered right, in the first instance, to give preference to those of which
the manuscripts were unique, or the materiale of which would help to fill up
blanke in English history f rwhich no satisfactory and authentia information
hitherto existed iu anya ssible form. One great object the Master of the Bolis
had in view was to fo a corpas historicam within reasonable limite, and which
should be ae comple ae possible. In a subject of so vast a range, it was im·
portant that the historica] student should be able to select euch volumes as
conformed with his own peculiar tastes and studies, and not be put to the expense
of purchasing the whole collection ; sn inconveniente inseparable from any other
plan than that which has been in this instance adopted.
of the Ohronicles and Memorials, the following volumes have been published.

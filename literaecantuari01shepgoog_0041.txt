occasional employment of c, is found at the end of the

15th century, when Prior Sellyng brought over fron

Italy the revived classical forms which he found

The Latin syntax of the Middle Ages hardly varied
from that of classical timos, when the pen was held by
n scholar ; but there are to be found in the letters many
instances oi slipshod composition, and even violated
grammatical rules; the result of wnnt of skill in the
composer. Such errors, which are fcwer in number than
might be expected, are reproduced without correction.
Am0ng many mediaeval forms which, deliberately and
usually, vary from classioal usage are to be found the
following: celendereos, perhendinare, arcs (for herlus),
arciorem and artare (for arctiorem and arctare), vali·
tado, elemosina, obciorcm (for aptiorem), sacchore (for
auscultare), coar-tare and cohartare (for coarctare), ca

destroy the likeness to the original, or even to express
a precise meaning in those cases where the composition
of the old writer is cloudy and ambiguous.

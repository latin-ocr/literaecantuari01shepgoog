INTRODUOTION. XXXV

same reasoning applies with almost squallores to the
Latin letters, and hence it has been considered best to set
down the words of the records letter by letter as they are
found in the original, one only exception being made in

the case oi diphthongs‚ which are used in obedienoe io
asalutary law imposed upon the editors of volumes in
this series of Chronicles and Memorials. Oonjeotural
emendations are of course not admissible in the tran·
scription of ancient texts, where the original essay or
chroniole is the work oi a professional writer and where
more than one copy usually existe, in which case oom-
parison of the various MSS. will give the true reading3
but in the present collection, written often by penmen
only moderately skilled in their work, and sometimes
by men who wrote with difficulty, slips of the pen—
ornissions or transpositione of words or letters—frc-
quently occur in which tho error is palpable and the re-
quired correction sels-evident ; in such cases the editor
has ventured to add a missing word, indicating the addi-
tion by placing the words in brackets, and to make such
other corrections as are plainly required In words con-
taining the sibilant letter t, es ratio, pratia, mututrb,
appel-lotio, the medieeval scribes used both c and t in
the penultimate syllable; some authorities say always
the first ; others always the second3 whilst others again
believe that both letters were used indifferently 3 the
differentes ol opinion arising from the fact that in the
MSS. the two letters are so much alilre in form that they
can only be discriminated by very close examination. In
this conflict of opinions the editor, falling back upon
the immense mass of MS. at his command, has found
that wherever these two letters can be distinguished
(that is to say, usually but not invariably) the c is always
employed from the middle of thoreth up to quito the
end of the 15th century. Before and aiter those dates
the t occurs almost as regularly as in the present day.

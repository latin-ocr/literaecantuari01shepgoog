Greeting and everlasting joy. Know that we are
most· grateful for your warning about the frauda and
deceptions that our bondmen of Rishorough and Halton
have put upon us, in connexion with the taxation of the
ancient demesne of the Orown. And please to under-
stand that henceforth they shall not have at our hands
such favour as they have hitherto enjoyed‚ and it much
troubles us that ever wo should have asked you or any·
body 10 show favour to them. And therefore we pray
you that you will show yourself a friend to us and to
our Church, as you have been aforetime‚ and especially
now in the matter of the aforesaid tax in the case of the
inquest of honest men, which has, by your help, pro·
nounced in our favour. And (we desire) that you he
pleased 10 punish the said bondmen sharply for every
kind 01 mespres, with all the rigour 01 the law, without

showing them any manner 01 favour. And since you
are astonished that we do not mention 10 you any-
thing about the payment 01 the deht which we owe you,
be assured that this was the chief cause for which we -
made our way towards the Vale (01 Aylesbury)‚ in order
to inform you by word of mouth3 and therefore we pray
you that you will make haste so that we may have a
talk os soon as we come 10 those parts, for we have the
affairs above mentioned much at heart. And you will
find us at Rishorough or at Halton on Tuesday or ch·
nesday next coming. Andif you cannot hastan so much,
certify us by the hearer 01 these where we can meet
you as we traval towards our journeys end Adieu,

‘¹ sacri Papae Magistri J. de Sancto claro’'; and the
letter, as exemplificd by the Bishop of Tusculum (judex

ct conservator. . . ‚per Apostolicam Sedem depu-
tatus), is addressed to John St Clare, Canon of London,

Rector of Fulham, and Chaplain of Cardinal Gentili ol r

St. Martin in Monte, and to the Bishop of London, and

the Abhot of St. Edmunds, on the one part3 and to the ξ
Archbishop and tho chapter of Canterbury on the other. ,
ln lhis, the Pope recites St. Clare’s advocacy ol the ’

causo ol St. Augustine’s Abbey in opposition to the Arch-
bishop, and adds that when St. Clare asked of the latter,

enraged by this opposition, a ⁴license permitting him to

visit the Curia, he replied: “Quod ipsum in persona et ε
“ rebus persequeretur, in tantum quod exinde totum ς
“ regnum Angliae loqueretur '’ ; in consequence of which ὲ
threat, the Pope continues, “idem Magister Johsnre, ³
“ super hoc se offerens coram nobis, per instrumenta i
“ publica faciendo plenam fidem, ac reputans sihi j
“corporaliter et realiter periculum imminere, nobis l

“ humiliter supplicavit ut providere sibi de proteo·
“tionis et defensionis remedio dignaremur? 'l’hc

apostolic letters then commit the protection of St. Olore ζ

in the future to the Bishop of Tusculum, who warns the

· Archhishop and the Chapter, that if hehe molestedin r

person or in goods, and if the molestation be not atoned

sor, then that the Archbishop shall ipso facto incur the ¹
successive sentences of exclusion from the chumh, sus· ,
pensiori ο divinis, and excommunication3 and that the ,

Chapter in like manner shall, asa corporation‚ be put
under an interdict. In either case the offender is re
quired, if summoned hy St. Clare's proctor, ιο appear
before the Bishop of Winohester or the Dean of St.
Paule, to whom jointly and severally is committed the
power of pronouncing thc threatened sentences. When
relations such as those above alluded to existed between
St. Clare and the Archbishop, it is not wonderful that
the latter should be unwilling ιο see the former selected
as standing counsel of his own monastery.

messenger3 one cf his monks, who has received favours
from the Chapter of Canterbury, is asked tc forward the
business ; and the King of Frauce is petitioued ιο renew
the delivery ol the wine which has been intennitted for

at least ten years. After these petitione the register con·
tains copies of all the most important royal clrarters re·
lating to the wine, duplicatas of which, certified by a
notary, were sent with the petition, ιο prove the title of
the monks, which might be supposed to have passed out
of memcry hy the lapse oi time, and ao become liahle to
challenge. It must be noticed that in this instance,
although the petitione here mentioned (which are undated)
are entered in the register under the year 1367, the
originale from which they were copied cannot possibly
have borne that date ; for in the first place they speak of
a te'n years interruptionto the delivery of the wine caused
by war, just at the very time that the treaty of Bretigny
had enaured a seven years peace; and again the King
invoked is a Philip, really Philip vl, who had died
nearly twenty years before. The solution of thia riddle
isnot difficult· There were, probably, in 1367 some
arrears of the wine, and there were certainly threatenings
of a renewal oi the war between the ccuntries, which
induced the Prior ιο make a hasty snatch at his wine
before the hursting cf the war-cloud. Hereupon he
caused copies of the last correspondenoe of the kind,
when the cheumstances were somewhat similante bc
made in the registera, and then οηοιαιιο avenacia he
sent off his duplicatas ιο Franco. Several other instances
similar ιο the above will bc found occurring here and
there in these volumes. As the recorda printed in the
present volume do not carry the history oi the wine
beyond the first half cf the ltth century, it will be prc-

ancient charter was made ιο Louis XI. and how it was
answered, until the men who were active in pushing this

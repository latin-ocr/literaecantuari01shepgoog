Archbishop Richard, who succeeded Becket, was Gerr. 1,
⁰PP080<1 by Abhot Roger, who, although a monk of the ⁷⁷·

Archbishop's own Convent of Christ Choreb, refused pro·
sessiou in the Archbishop's terms; appealed to Rome ;
and at last received henediction from the hands of the
Pope himself, who however bestowed it with the reserva·
tion: “Salvo jure et dignitate Oantuariensis Ecclesiae.”
This incomplete victory gained by the ahbey‚ and the
grant of the use of the pontifical mitre and ring to
Abbot Rogeu excited the indignationes the monks of
Christ Ohurch, but from this time we hear no more in
the chronicles of the question of profession.

The monks of St. Augustina’s grounded their refusal to
humble themselves before their diocesan upon papal Bulla
which they possessed, as they asserted, hut which they
hesitated te submit for examination, and the reason for
this is not far to seek; for, about thirty years afterAbbot
Silvester's henediction, a discovery was mede which put
them entirely out of court. It was in fact shown thet
the Bull upon which they relied was an easily recog-
nised forgery. This circumstance, so unfavourable in
the upshot to the ahhey, is naturally not mentioned
by Thorn, who besides being the historiari was also the
advocate of St. Augustine’s3 but, which is more to be
wondered at, Gervase also, who was the advocate em·
ployed by the other side, pessos over the discovery with·
out notice. This is themora remarkable, since, as
Gervase was a monk of Christ Ohurch, and hy profes·
sion a writer of chronicles, and therefore well acquainted
with the evidenees aud records of his house, he must, ’
beyond doubt, have seen, andrejoiced over, the parch-
ments about to be here described. Honest historiens,
then, even those who were contemporaries of the
events which they recorded, sometimes sinned ut
least by omission. The history of the discovery is
fully explained in the documents 22 and 23 of the ·
appendix. Rejecting agood deal of irrelevant matter,

Necham was a man who devoted 1111111010101100,1101111111111111 the
twellth centuary. In the ‘⁸ De Naturis Rerum ” are 10 10 found what may 10
called the rudimenta 01 many 10101000 mixed up with much error and ignorante.
Nechham wae not thought infallible, even hy his contemporaries, lor RogerBacon
1011111101 him, “ thie Alexander in many things wrote what was true and ueefuh
‘¹ but he neither cau nor ought by juet title to be rechoned among authoritiee.'’

and general tone 01110 11 prevalent iu 110 twe fth century. The poem entitled
“De Laudibus Diviuoe apientiae” appears to be a metricat paraphrase or

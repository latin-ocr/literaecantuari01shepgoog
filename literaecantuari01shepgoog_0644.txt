'l'he “ Repressor ’' may be considered the earliest piece 04 good theological dis·
quisition 04 which our English prose literature can boast. The author was born
about the end 04 the fourteenth century, consecrated Bishop 04 St. Asaph in
the year 1444, 0041 translated 40 4140 000 04 chichester in 1450. While Bishop 04
St. Asaph, he zealously defended his brother prelatas 44004 the attacks of 414000

more profitably spent, and his dignity better maintained, 10 the performance 04

Lollurds, aud against their general 4100441000 the “ Repressor ’' is directed Pecock

full account 04 the views 04 4140 Lollurds aud 04 4140 arguments by which they were ¹
supported, aud because it 0001040 us to ascertain the 04040 04 feeling which ulti·

In confirmation ol this statement of Gervase the
muniment room ol Canterbury Oathedral can still show
not 'only one oi these counterparts of the composition,
which, as Malmesbury and, alter him, all the other
historians report, were witnessed by thirteen bishops and
cleven of the great abbots of the kingdom, and which
according to Gervase were fortified by the apposition
of the King's seal; but also in the same portfolio is pre-
served the actual document which was executed by the
very parties concerned‚ the very parchment which bears
the characteristic roughly drawn, deaply scrawled croso
of the Conqueror,·ths delicate sign made by the Quaen,
and the autograph signatures (each to all appearances
havinga character indicative of the personal qualities
of the writer) of Lanfranc and Thomas as principale, of
Hubert the Legate, and of the Bishops Wulstan of
Worcester‚ Walkeliu of Winchester, Erlastns of Thetford,
and Remigius of the Oxfordshire Dorchester, speciully
invited to bc official witnessesl Tho other bishops and
abhots, whose names arc attached to the counierparts
which were written on the same day as the actual
deed (and even, both text and signatores, by the same
hand as tha original), were doubtless present in the
hall at the time of the execution oi the composition, and
are therefore justly set down as witnesses of the fact3 but
those who really attested the signatures ol the two Arch-
bishops concemed were the King and Quaen, the Legate,
and the before-named four Bishops, only.

This original record was only identified a few years
ago; the mors important looking counterpart bearing
the great secl having until that time quite eclipsed
it; and the chroniclers, even Eadmer‚ who was a Oan-
terbury monh, and who actually handled and copied
the record when it was used to support Archbishop {ltffffiv
Ralph’s claim in 1119, cite only the counterpart, with 252⁰ ⁰

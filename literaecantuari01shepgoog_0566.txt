Prior of the Ohurch 01 Canterbury greeting‚ and health
on earth, and glory in heaven. Dear friends, concerning
the bend for a hundred mares about which we wrote to
you lately‚ we pray you to extract from your accounts the
separate sums which have been paid to us or to others
in our bahali, and then to inform us how much balance
remains to be paid. And plesse to understand, that Sir
John Launge, Knight, has sent us a sealed letter to be
delivered unto your hands, and an open promissory note,
corroborated by the saal of the Prevdtof Paris for a
hundred pounds sterling, 01 which he has made recog-
nizance at Paris, before the said Prevdt and 111000111-
monalty of Paris, that he owns it to us; which open
letter we send 10 you for inspection, for we have hopes
that by these means we shall have satisfaction of this
debt. And we promise you in good faith, that 101 your
trouble you shall be so rewarded, that you and the said
Oompany shall hold yourselves well content. And 11 11
so hoppen that you be not immediately paid these hun-
dred pouuds irem the Treasury 01 our Lord the King,
and you can accommodate us with money 01 your own
until the time when you can be paid from the said
Treasury, know for 0 truth, that whatever loss we our·
selves incur, you shall not suffer through us. And
whereas James Nichole, iately, at Oanterbury, spoke to
us of some bargains which will concern you and us about
which he can more fully inform you, please to understand
that you and your Gompany in these bargains shall come
before all others, aa far aa we can agree between us in the
said business, provided that you apply in time before
the bargain is made with anyone else. In the above-
mentioned affairs 01 ours please to be our friend and take
the aforesaid affairs 10 heart, and we too in any similar

case will take your affairs to heart ¹with all our might.
Adieu, doc.

the said Edmoud will not withdraw from his suit, as it
is said, without an ordor from you; we davoutly pray
you, very daar Sire, that, for the honour and the love
of God, andos Saint Edward the king, and of Saint
Thomas, that you will be pleased to allow and to act
so that the said Edmoud may be williug to withdraw
from his suit, and to stop the troubles which he is
making for us and our Ohurch, which church you have
ever especially loved and greatly helped in all its con-
oerns. God be with you very dearSira, and give you
good life and long. Given in our chapter house the 7th

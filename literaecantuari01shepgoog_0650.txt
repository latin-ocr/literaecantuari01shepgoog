On 25 J uly 1822, the House of comnons presented an address to the Orown,
satin g thet the editions cf the works of our ancient historiam were inconvenient
ud defective; that many of their writings still remeined in manuscript, end, in
ome cases,in a single copy only. They added, “thatun uniform and con·
¹ venient edition ol' the whole, published under His Majesty's royel sanction,
⁸ would be an undertaking honourable to His Mejesty's reign, and conducive to
‘ the advencement of historioel and constitutionel knowledge ; that the House
‘ therefore humbly besought His Mejesty, that He would be graoiousl pleesed ·
‘⁸ to give such directions es HisMayesty, in His wisdom, might think fit, for
‘⁸ the publication of a complete edition of the ancient historiens of this realm,
‘⁸ and assured His Majesty that whatever expense might be necessary for this
“ urpose would be made good.'’

'Phe Master of the Rolls, being very desirous that effect should be given to the
resolution of the House cf Commoris, submitted to Her Magesty's Treasnry in
1857 a plen for the publication of the ancient chronicles an memoriale of the
United Kingdom‚ and it was adopted accordingly. In selecting these works, it
was considered right, in the first instance, to give preference to those of which
the manuscripts were unique, or the materiale of which would help to fill up
blanks in English history f rwhich no satisfactory and authentia informaticn
hitherto existed in anye ssible form. One great object the Master cfthe Bolls
had in view was to fo a corpus historicam within reasonable limite, end which
should bs as comple eas possible. In a subject of so vast a range, it was im·
portant thet the historicel student should be able to select such volumee aa
conformed with his own peculiar testesand studies, and not be put to the expense
of pnrchasing the whole collection: an inconvenience insepareble from any other
plan than that which has been in this instance adopted.

Of the Chronicles end Msmoriels, the following volumes have been published.

They embrace the period fr'cm the earliest time of British history down to the

end of the reign cf Heury VII.

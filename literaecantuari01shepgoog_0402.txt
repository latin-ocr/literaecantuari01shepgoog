Greeting. Whereas we have learnt through the

officere of the Sheriff of Kent, who dwell at Canterbury‚
that from the feast of St. Michael last past, to the
morrow os All Souls, they have received no King's writ
through our servants for any affairs which concern us ; and

’ on that account they marvel much, as also do we. It is
t expedient, for your honour, and our profit, that you take

out write effi-fo from the rolls of the Justiees of the
King's Bench‚ sor the debt which Sir Walter de
Huntingfeld owes us (secured) by his recognizance
made in the Oourt ol King’s Bench. And also a judg-
ment writsor the debt that Sir Warreis de Valoynes owes
ns. And also other writs for the dehts which Thomas
le Blak os Sandwieh, and many other debtors owe to us,
as you well know, against whom we have taken out writs
which ought to have been delivered to the Sheriff at Tri-
nitytide last past, which writs have never come into the
Sheriffs hands, nor into those of any of his clerks who
have authority to receive and make return to such a
King’s writ3 hut latelyour writ was found with its seal
entire and no execution done, and of this we have great
marvel. And therefore do yon proceed so discreetly in
these, and our other matters which we have to transact
in the King's Oourt, that our friendS, and we ourselves,
may be able to see and know that our attornies are as
diligent in eondueting our business at 'the King's Court,
aa other attornies are ior the business oi their employers.
And ifonything hasbeen dispatched of our saidaffairs

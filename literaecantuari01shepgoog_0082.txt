whatever means, sufficient influence with the Chapter to

induce them to concede the privilege. The first eminent

’ tenant of this mansion whose name occurs in the recorda

was John Bokyngham, Bishop of Lincoln, who, in 1397, &stifft

this time, whilet Tewkesbury field was being fought,
Warwick’s fleat under Faulconbridge came to Sandwich

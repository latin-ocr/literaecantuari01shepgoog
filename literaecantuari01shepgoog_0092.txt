6 Mor. 1326. After the Quaen¹ has been abroad a¹⁶⁸2 171,
whole year and more, the Prior complains of the expense 1⁷2.

12 March 1326, Hopes of peace were entertained from 1⁷³·
the mission of the Cardinal Bishops of Albano and Pales·
trina, who had drawn up a form of treaty which the
Kingof Franceand Queen isabella had willingly accepted.
The Nuntii proposed to corneto England, and it was
hopcd that to the King of England also the treaty would
be acceptable. When the Quaen and Princo arrive in
England‚ as it is expected they will soon de, decet et repectit
rmercuter occurrere non nouom obsistere, the Prior
writes3 but he owns, that if they bring too many followers
in their company, it may make the Archbishop‘s naviga-
tion more intricate. Moreover the Popehaving decidedly
shown himself on the side of the Qneen and her brother
the King of France, it will not be right (or expedient)
to oppose the side which he supports3 seeing that such
opposition would savour of disrespeet to the head of the
Ohurch. If the King be too exactingalittledisobedieuce
may be tried, for “the commandments of God himself
‘¹ are not implicitly obeyed, nor can those of man possibly
“ bc so in these days.” The Prior thinks that alanning
reporta of a large French army collected for the invasion
of England may be disregarded3 inasmuch as the con-
stantly passing travellers would have seen and reported
the preparatione. A closing of the ports would certainly
be the first step, since it would prevent the eonveyance
of intelligence to the threatened cnemy3 and this step
the Prior thinks might legitimately cause apprehensiou.

He expresses a most anlavourable opinion of the strength

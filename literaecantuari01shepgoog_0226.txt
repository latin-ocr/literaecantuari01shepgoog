terbury, greeting. KnoW, Sir, that we have otton heard
various things thet tend to the great disparagement of
yourselfi and to the injury of your honour, and this
both before the death of our very dear friend Sir War-
reis your father, and since then And we, for love ofand
on account of him, and for your credit, have cheoked and
hindered many persons who desired to complain of
you to the great ones of the land ; and also we have
understood that other persons of the district have often
brought divers and heavy charges against you before the
officere ot our Lord the King, who thereos bear record ;
and we have often before now prayed and procured that
they should refrain and still withhold from you the
’ execution consequent upon the indictments' and present·
ments which they beve received on the oeths of many
men of these parts. And therefore we marvel greatly
that you bring together, and often maintain, so ‘many
armed followers to the great terror of the people‚
for the purpose of doing dishonour‚ damage, and
despite to other persons of the district, against right and
reason. Wherefore, we pray you in friendship and
pressingiy, that you will he pleased to take other and
better method in such cases, so that neither we nor others
may have occasion to complain of such getherings‚ nor to
prove elsewhere the outrages which they eausathet isto
say, where we and others know how to obtain good
redress for ourselves and for our dependente who feel
themselves much eggrieved. God he with you, and keep
you, and give you a long life to behave well. Given at
Brookon St. Laurenoe's day in the year of grace 1324.

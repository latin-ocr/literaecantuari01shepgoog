the monastery, and these form a pleasant eontrast to the
dull law papers which fill the registers of the period
These detached letters narrowly escaped destruction
once on stirne, when, duringa rearrangement of the.
cathedral recorda they were from a lawyer's point of
view considered to be worthless, as having no relation to
estates or income, and were therefore banishedtosheds and
outhouses‚ only to he rediscovered and reclaimed a few
years ago. A considerable part of these-the first por·
tion which was recovered-was published by the Oamden
Societyin 1877, with the title “ Christ Church Letters ;''
they are not here reproduced, because, these being
accessible in the Society's volume, it is thought better

not to occupy precious space with matter which has .

already been printed, whilst so much inedited material
is awaiting publication. The denched lettersaremostly
interrogative, and the questions they propose are some-
times answered in those drawn from the registers.

The letters of the registers are spoken of as coyriea aa
though when the original letter was complete and ready
for dispatch the cancellarius transcribed it into his
letter book ; but in a large number oi cases, especially
in those of early date, it would be more proper to con·
'sider the record in the register aa a dauft rather than a
copy; for it constantly happens that the example in the
register, after having been written on the page, has
undergone interlineationa and cancellings, in the same ⁴
handwriting as the text ; changes being made in the com-
position amounting to a recasting of whole clauses, so
extensive as to be quite incompatible with the idea oi
a copy made from a completed instrument, first blun-
dered hy a careless clerk and then corrected. In one
case the title ofa letter reads: “Littera regraciatoria
“ super regimine corporis nostri‚” dre.; the appended
letter beginning, “ Pater et domine reverende; debono
‘⁸ regimine corporis meique vestro sano consilio et
“ informacione sum usus, et febres pessimas jam evasi,

“ ao aliis beneficiis infinitis vestrae clemencia gratias

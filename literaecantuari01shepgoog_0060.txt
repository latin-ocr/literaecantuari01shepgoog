lifetime the Archbishop had been a genereus almsgiver,
whose free-handed charity had personally endeared him
to others beside the auti-Despenser party, and in con-

that he was excluded from the kalendar. His tomb in
the cathedral was for many years frequented as a place
01 pilgrimege and oblation by a not inconsiderable
number 01 devotees, 10000 whom the convent 01 Christ
Churcb derived a respectable ravenue. The accounts 01

months, the 011001ος0 “ Aa 10001000 Domini Rcbcrti

twenty in the next yeer; 101319 sinking to ten ; and
10110 yearlfollowing suddenly mounting 10010010 pounds‚
the largest sum ever received in any 000 year. After
reaching this 0000100000, 110 offerings fell off in a fairly
constant 00110, so that by AD. 1337 they had 0100001010
three pounds. At this 00101110 000100 01 accounts is

the church; but when, under the date Α.Ι). 1370, 110
accounts are resumed, the entry “Dc 100010 Roberta'
‘⁶ Arslaieptocopi” has disappeared from the partae obla-

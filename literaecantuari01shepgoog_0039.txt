“ resero,dzc.'' Here itis impossible to avoid the iutereuec
that tlre writer (the Prior), iu thanlring his correspon-
dent l the Arehbishop) for usetul medical advice, composed
the draft in the register, writing it with his own haud3
for certainly a elerlr prefixing a title to a copy oto
completed letter of the Pn'or’s, which he had been
directed te transcribe into the register, would have
written in the title: “Littera regraciatoria superbene
“ regimine corporis Domini Prioris,” anduot “corporis

is ot course not so significant, because the clerk would
reproduce the very words of the Prior's autograph.

Again it cannot be supposed that a mere copying

ol the letters, and atotal destructiones the arehaic ¹
quointuess of the style, and the less of much of the κ

philological velue, no attempt hasbeen made to correct i

errors of syntax, or to bring the language up to the l
standard of the “Freneh of Parys ;’' each writer being

allowed to represent, in his own manner, the speech

used by the cultivated classes of society in his day. Ι The

within e century, one by Archbishop Richnrd and Abbot
Roger‚ and another by Archbishop Edmund and Abbot
Robert, and he accepts the statement, made in the petition
sent to him bythe abbey,thet from the first foundation this
monastery hae been exempt from ordinary jurisdictione:
end then, asserting that the Arcbbishops have encroacbed
upon this privilege, aud that the omnposit‘ions were
nujust to the obbey‚ he testatos and widens the old
exemption from episcopal control The Chapter of St.
Augustine's had formerly asserted thet they and their
monastery only were exempt from visitetion and other
episcopal intrusione, but Bonifaoe extende the immunity
thus: “ipsos et illud, cum omnibus membris suis, et
“ ecclesiis, capellis, cenodochiis, hospitalibus, muntiis
“ necnon castris, villis, maneriis, domibus, grangiis, et
“ possessionibus, terris, redditibus, et quibuscumque
“ bonis ad ecs et preafatum monasterium in praesen-
“ tiorum spectantibus, ac eis queo . . . . . im·
“posterum poterunt adipisci; ..... et omnibus
‘¹ personis sui ordinis et aliis eis subjectis, degenti·
“ bus in eisdem, ab omni potestate, jurisdictione, sub
“ jectione, etque dominio, tem venerabilis fratris nostri
“ Archiepiscopi et dilectorum filiorum Capituli Oan-
“turriensis . . . . . . . quamalinrum
“quarumlibet ecclesiasticarum personarum, absolvi-
“ mus, exemimus, et perpetuo liberamus,'’ dre. This
extension of the limite of the shedow of protection
cast by the monastery robbed the Archbishop of his
power in a very large proportion of his diocese, and was
necessarily resisted. In the Arohbishop's appeal to the
Curia, he complains thet Boniface’s privilege was ob
tcined by a fraudulent representation thet the exemption
already existed. He adds that the Abbot and Chapter have
since the granting of the privilege actually instituted to
all the churchcsof which they owned the patronage, where
formerly they presented clerks for institution totheArch·
bishop3 that they exact an ooth of cononical obedience

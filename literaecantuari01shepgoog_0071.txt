Clement V. to conciliate the King of England, whose
subject he had been when Archbishop ofBordeanx. After

ri .x.‚ this, says Thornt “the Archbishop left the monastery
· at peace‚’' implying that being well beaten he sumen·

dered ; bnt it is rather to be believed that, having
obtained the Pope’s “ declaration‚'’ by which all the new
usurpatione of the “privilegium '' of 1300 were practi-

without suspicion, be accepted as true. He says that
the Arobbishop cited the Abbot and his Chapter to show
by what right they asserted that the churchcs had been
by competent authority granted to thern in proprios

them contumacious, but reserved bis sentence ; thereupon
the Chapter of St. Augustine’s appealed to the Pope,

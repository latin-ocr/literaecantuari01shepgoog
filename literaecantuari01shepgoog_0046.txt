to Angustiae personally3 hut his ambiguous directions

are by no means calculated to explain the relations which ·
he intended to exist in the future between theOhurches.

He writes: '“ Ad Eboracum vero civitatem tc volumus Beue 1„
“episcopum mittere, quern ipse judicaveris ordinaram·
“ ita duntaxat, ut si eadem civitas cum finitimis locis
“verbum Dei receperit, ipse quoque duodecem epi-

inofficiant as evidence on bchalf of the equality of the
two sees, and nevertheless it furuished the foundation
for all the arguments in favour of this equality. stubbsffgf¹13335

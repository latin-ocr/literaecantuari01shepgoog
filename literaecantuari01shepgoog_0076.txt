Christ Ohurch‚ occurs constantly in this volume ; butas
the history is herc taken up just aiter the transfer 01 the
port with its customs from the monastery to the men,
it is necessary to explain the connexion which, during
several earlier centuries, existed between the convent and
the scaport.

In An. 966 liadgar by charter restored and confirmed neg. Β.
10 Archbishop Dunstan and the church 01 (lanterhury ¹⁷⁰·
all their rights at Sandwich‚ including both those which
at that date they still possessed, audlalso those which at
some previous time had been taken from them. In
1111013 the convent had apparently again been de-
spoiled 01 some or all 01 its rights in the port3 and Onut,
present in person at Christ Ohurch, gave (or restored) to
it tho harbour with all its customs and dues, the exclusive
privilege 01 ferrying passengers across the river in the
‘¹ vere-boats,'' and all the wharss and warehouses neces·
sary 101 exerciciug its rights; confirming the grant and
giving 1ο 11 a ceremonial solemnity by, with his own
hands, lifting his golden crown from his head and offer·

Sandwich (as the successor 01 the Roman Ritupiae
whose ruins still crown the low send 11111 near the town),
being ¹the chief English port through which trade was
carried on with the Continent, produced a considerable
revenue from the duties levied upon imported goods,
sufficient 10 tempt the eupidity 01 Odo the Bishop and
Earl, who, custing the monks, seized the port soon niter·
the Norman Conquest. Odo’s enjoyrnent 01 his usurped
possession was but 01 short duration, 101, 1n consequence
01 pressure put upon him by Archbishop Lanfranc, 11οθ Reos-R
made a complete restit tution to the monastery of them

town and the port witht 1 ts profit s, tthe King confirming
the act 01 his half-brother. Henry I. by charter iirmly
reestablished the monastery in its regained rights, and
Henry ΙΙ. confirmed all these rights in the ternis of his
grandfather's charter.

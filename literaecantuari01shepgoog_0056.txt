The twent ty ewentlul years during which Αιοιιιιὶιιιορω Arcu-
Wincheleey filled the see of Oauterbury are very in- Wiu ’Ἥ
adequately represented ιιι these letters. As has alreadyge 0'511
been pointed out, Archbishop Raynold, Winchelsey’spe mii
successor ,anxiously consulted Prior Eustry'‘ ιιι his poli-⁰¹¹2 ‘¹⁰⁰2 ’Μ

tical difficulties, and (seeing how moment oue were thenon mogi?

soenes in which Wincheleey played a paxt)it might
have been expected that he too would have had reoourse
to the eounsels of this Prior, during at least the twelve
troubled years with which hie pontificato began But
in Raynold's case the Prior had become venerable from
years and experienda, whilst the Archbiehop was a oom-
paratively young man, glad ιο profit by the wisdom os
his senior. Archbishop Winchelsey, on the contrary, wne
not only in all probability the elder, but he was a man
eudowed with such force of character, that in all his
history he seems never ιο heve sought advice from any·
one, or to have cvaded responsihility by sheltering him·
seli behind anyone’s wisdom ; one result of this indepen-
dence being that hut few oi his letters- occur in thie
collection. His exulting tone in the letter 32, where
he reporta how he hes out-generalled and defied
the Archbishop of York; the fear with which his
chaplain regarded him (34), a fear so abject that he
preferred to invent and utter a false tale ιο impose upon
his master, rather thau run the risk of rousing his indig-
nation against the Prior of Christ Ohurch by offering
him, in the name ol the latter,a gift which eo proud a
prelata would ιιοι think worthy οι hie acceptancc; the
nusparing measures which he prescribes for curbing the
encroachments oi the Archbishop of York (37), are all
indicatione oi the haughty and unyielding character,
which (except in the one case of his submission ιο the

King in 1305) the historiens heve attributed to him
But although the Prior was nottho Archhishop's ad-
vieer he was certainly hie triend3 so much so, thet
when restored ιο his functione at the end of his exile, hut

before his return ιο England, he specially appointied him
Π arare.

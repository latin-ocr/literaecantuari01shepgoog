To his very deur friend, dac. greeting. We thank
you heartily for your letters which you lately sent us,
and for your letters which you sent to Master Thebaud,
the physician to my La'dy the Queen Isabella‚ that he
should pay us thirty pounds sterling out of the money
of your London rents. And please to notice, very dear
friend, that we have caused your letters to be handed to
the said Master Thebaud, that he might cause to bc
paid to us thirty pounds sterling according to that
which you sentus in your letters, but he has ansvered
plainly that ho neither has, any money of yours nor
will he pay any to us. And therefore we pray you, as
our trusty friend, that you will please to provide and
arrange some other convenient way by which we may
be able to obtain the thirty pounds ,for our French

benking company of the Bardi of Paris, or by some other

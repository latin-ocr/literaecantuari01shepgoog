toegther with all the notices sent out cn the occasion of
the death and the election of aprior, arc omitted from
this selection, unless the persons concerned were public
characters3 or unless some exceptional circumstances
caused a special form tc be droam up for the occasion;
hut care has been taken to include at least one typical
specimen ol every formula in the work.

The arrangement of undated letters in correct chrono-
logical order has involveda good deal of trouble, but itis
believed that (with very few slips) a fairly satisfactory ι
result hasbeen reached ; by (1) attention to the placa of
each example in the register and by comparison with
surrcundin'g dated examples3 (2) by studyof the subject
matter, which often indicates the place of a letter in a
series; (3) by comparison of the writing with that of
scribes who have left damd specimena The first of these
processes ought alone to have sufficed for indicating the
date of every enrolled letter; seeing thal when tuo dated
letters occur with several undated examples between thern
it may fairly be inferred that, starting from thc first which
bears a date, those which follow were written on various
days extending from that of the first to that of the
second dated specimen. But it happened theta Chapter-
Glerk of the last century undertook to arrange these
registers lor the bookbiuder; finding them either un-
bound in quires, or, what is more likely, iu the shape of
torn, bound books, the detached contenis oi which were
mixed iu confusion. Itis not easy to say what rule the
Chapter-Olerk followed, bulthe rule, whatever it was,
was a bad one, and the result is bewildering. Where
there was any difficulty in finding the place of a few
quires, they were ‘thnrst among the others at randum,
with a note such as that which here follows: “ Nc quid

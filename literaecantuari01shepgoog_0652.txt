11111111 g that the editions of the works of our ancient historiam were inconvenient

rme ceassiu a single copy only. They added, “thatun uniform 11110011-
venient edition 01 111 w 011, publishsd under Hie ldaJesty'e royal sanction,

1857 a plan 101 111 publication of the ancient chroniclee an memoriale of the
United Kiogdom, audit was adopted accordingly. In selecting these werke, it
was considered right, iu the first instance, to give preference to those of which
the manuscripts were unique, or the materiale of which would help to fill up
blanke in English historyf rwhich uo satisfactory and authentic information
hitherto existed in anya ssible form. One great object the Master of the Rolle
had in view was to fo a corpus historicam within reasonable limite, and which
should be as comple as possible. In a subject 01 10 vast a range, it was im·
portent that the historical student should be able 10 select such volumee as

whilst in those of the city parishes divine service vas
performed, it would appear to be to the discredit of the r
cathedral‚ and therefore they declined to act upon Abp. ’

but laboriously compiled, by Archbishop Winchelscy's
eounsel, for his client's information on this subject The
counsel could apparently find nothing to the point in the
Canonlaw, and therefore was compelled in order to show
that he was earning his fee, to wonder· off into a moze of
decretals that did not bear upon the question at issue. In

bishops Islip of Canterbury and Thoresby of York came
to a compromise in the year 1355. By this composition
it was agreed, that each Arohbishop should have full ,
liberty to display his eroes in any part of the kingdom ¹

conam sors, on attaining the pontifioal dignity‚ should offerat ᾗ
the shrine of St. Thomas a silver image of a fully vested ῑ

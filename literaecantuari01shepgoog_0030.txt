of whose history is written in the present volumes hythe

bertof Kent, settled itself in and about the more or
less ruinous Roman basilica which was standing on the
site ol the present cathedral church at the end oi the
sixth century.

For four hundred years the metropolitical church, and
tha monastery dependent upon it, developed in riches

scarcely interrupted until the end of this long period,
and then the Danish invaders assailed the city, captured
and afterwards murdered the Archbishop, more than
once greatly damaged the fabric oi the church, and
devastated the domestic buildings of the monastery.

Immediately after the Norman Conquest, Archbishop
Lanfranc, who was summoned from N ormandy hy the
